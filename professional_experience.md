## Professional Experience
**Software Engineering Intern**  
*PicAxe* — Chicago, IL  
**June - September 2024**  
- Developed software to identify and extract images from scanned PDF documents, achieving an impressive F1 score of **0.96**, improving performance by **10%**.
- Fine-tuned the **YOLOv8 object detection model** to efficiently perform image extraction, achieving an F1 score of **0.99** with a runtime of **0.7s per image**, significantly enhancing speed.
- Scripted processes to seamlessly upload and download **20GB+ of image data** to and from **Google Drive** without crashes, ensuring smooth data handling.
- Automated the comparison of extracted images against original PDFs and generated **Excel reports** with detailed counts and statistics for analysis.
- Implemented a **template matching script** to accurately align manually extracted images with their respective document pages and retrieve their bounding boxes.
- Utilized bounding box data to create custom datasets for fine-tuning the **YOLOv8 model** for more precise object detection.
- Built a **lightweight Docker image** for the software distribution, reducing size to **500MB** by using **Debian Alpine Linux** for minimal resource usage.

**Software Engineer**  
*Goteff Superfoods* — Providence, RI  
**Jul 2021 - Aug 2022**  
- Enhanced customer retention by optimizing payment and delivery processes.
- Implemented Stripe API with webhook endpoints and tokenization for secure payments.

**Medical Imaging Research Assistant**  
*Lee Biomed-Optics Lab* — Providence, RI  
**Nov 2017 - Dec 2019**  
- Analyzed the viability of 3D liver spheroids using label-free Optical Coherence Tomography.
- Reconstructed 3D maps of diffusion coefficients in MATLAB to correlate intracellular motility with viability.
- Trained a CNN ML model with imaging data, achieving 94% accuracy in detecting spheroid deterioration.
- Co-authored a publication on pH and temperature effects on tissue health and deterioration.

**Infectious Diseases Research Assistant**  
*Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital* — Accra, GH  
**Jan - Dec 2017**  
- Led a 5-year retrospective study on TB/HIV co-infection therapy adherence.
- Developed a scalable, centralized, digitized patient database, synchronizing updates from clinics.
- Implemented REST API endpoints for data transfer among frontend, backend, and database.
- Made recommendations that improved therapy adherence by ~32% based on statistical regression analysis.
