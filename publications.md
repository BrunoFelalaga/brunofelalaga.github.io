## 1. The Giles Ecosystem â€“ Image Extraction from PDFs

**Abstract**:  
Many humanities researchers need to extract image data from scanned PDF files
that contain both text and images. Researchers who seek to extract hundreds or
thousands of images from PDF files will find it difficult to automate the process for
two reasons. First, the process of image extraction is difficult to automate without
prior coding skills. Second, a huge portion of image data exist in scanned PDF files
for which the process of image extraction is not easily performed by computers.
The Giles Ecosystem, a distributed system based on Apache Kafka, has recently
improved its image extraction function to be compatible with files that do not
embed images as separate from text. The system components are implemented
using Java and the Spring Framework, and are available under an Open Source
license on GitHub (http://github.com/diging/).

**Abstract**:  
The recent development of 3D tissue spheroids aims to address current limitations with traditional 2D cell cultures in various studies, including cancer drug screening and environmental toxin testing. In these studies, measurements of cellular viability are commonly utilized to assess the effects of drugs or toxins. Existing methods include live/dead assays, colorimetric assays, fluorescence calcium imaging, and immunohistochemistry. However, these methods involve the addition of histological stains, fluorescent proteins, or other labels to the sample; some methods also require sample fixation, which precludes the possibility of longitudinal study of viability. Confocal fluorescence imaging-based methods also suffer from insufficient delivery of labels near the center of 3D spheroids.

In this research, we demonstrate the use of label-free optical coherence tomography (OCT) for quantitative cellular viability imaging of 3D tissue spheroids. OCT intensity and decorrelation signals acquired from neurospheroids exhibited changes correlated with cellular viability as manipulated with ethanol. Interestingly, the intensity and decorrelation signals exhibited different time courses, suggesting they may represent different cellular processes in cell death. More quantitative measurements of viability using dynamic light scattering optical coherence microscopy (DLS-OCM) were also presented, which enabled 3D maps of the diffusion coefficient, showing a correlation with cellular viability manipulated by changes in temperature and pH. Applications of these novel methods to human-cell 3D spheroids were also discussed.
