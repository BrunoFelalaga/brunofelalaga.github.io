## Professional Experience
**Software Engineering Intern**  
*PicAxe* â€” Chicago, IL  
**June - September 2024**  
- Developed software to identify and extract images from scanned PDF documents, achieving an impressive F1 score of **0.96**, improving performance by **10%**.
- Fine-tuned the **YOLOv8 object detection model** to efficiently perform image extraction, achieving an F1 score of **0.99** with a runtime of **0.7s per image**, significantly enhancing speed.
- Scripted processes to seamlessly upload and download **20GB+ of image data** to and from **Google Drive** without crashes, ensuring smooth data handling.
- Automated the comparison of extracted images against original PDFs and generated **Excel reports** with detailed counts and statistics for analysis.
- Implemented a **template matching script** to accurately align manually extracted images with their respective document pages and retrieve their bounding boxes.
- Utilized bounding box data to create custom datasets for fine-tuning the **YOLOv8 model** for more precise object detection.
- Built a **lightweight Docker image** for the software distribution, reducing size to **500MB** by using **Debian Alpine Linux** for minimal resource usage.
